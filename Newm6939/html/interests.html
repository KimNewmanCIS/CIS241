<div><h2 align="center">Seahorses</h2>
<p>I have always been interested in salt water tanks. I started a tank for seahorses and in October 2016 was able to purchase my first 4 seahorses. Shortly after getting them 
they had babies. I have successfully raised over 100 seahorses from these 4 horses. One of the things I liked the most about having the seahorses is that even though they are
fish they each have a different personality. Some have been shy and hide in the back corners of the tank while others will swim up to you and eat out of your hand. One of my favorites 
would hitch to my hand each time I reached into the tank.

<div><h2 align="center">Lacrosse</h2>
<p>My son started playing lacrosse in 1st grade. The team he was on folded the next season and my husband and a group of us decided we could put together a team to continue 
the lacrosse teams. We have been involved for many years. My son has not played for a season but I am continuing to be involved for this next season. I love all the team age 
groups but my favorite to watch are the kindergarten-2nd grade. The k/2 team are my little bobble heads. Their helmets are as big as they are and they 
have a hard time running with the extra weight on their heads. I love watching all the players grow and advance in skill.

<div><h2 align="center">Gardening</h2>
<br/> 
<p>I grew up with a garden on our property and love the taste of fresh vegetables. There is something about growing your own food that makes it so much better. Living in the city 
we now have a smaller back yard. I did some research and came up with a plan for a garden that takes less square footage. I got a couple 55 gallon drums used for food storage. 
I carefully measured out where I wanted to be able to plant the vegetables and cut the slits. The picture is of a finished product full of lettuce, broccoli and kale. You can see 
the barrel next to the lettuce was just planted. I found that the barrel had some issues with getting enough sun on all sides so I am going to put it on a lazy susan to be able to 
turn it regularly. I got a great crop of lettuce that year.

<p>I love fostering dogs. My family started fostering because we lost our dog and were not yet ready to get a dog of our own. We knew eventually we would be ready but were looking for just the right dog. 
Our first dog came to us on August 28, 2016 her name was Pibbles. Every dog we fostered was an awesome dog. Some had a few more challenges than others but all were friendly. There were 
many we came close to keeping. Cole came into our home and hearts on December 6, 2017. We knew right away he fit perfectly with our family. He had another home lined up before we 
took him in. He was with us to recover from a cold before joining his new family. The family's older dog didn't like his puppy ways and we were blessed to adopt him. </p>
