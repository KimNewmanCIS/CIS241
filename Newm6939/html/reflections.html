I really enjoyed <b>CIS 241 Web Development 1.</b> While I have been editing websites for many years and built a few through CMS systems like 
Wordpress, I have never worked with HTML5 with CSS. I could do most coding in HTML5 but never knew how to validate it. I would simply make my changes to the website and if 
it worked properly in the browser I was using I figured the changes were correct. In addition, being able to make sure the code 
validates as proper CSS or HTML5 using the validation websites, will help me learn how to code properly in the future. I am sure there is much trial and error work I have done 
on my sites that can now be cleaned up and corrected.
</p>

<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
Learning how to change a websites CSS file to adjust the style of the website will really help me with updating websites. I now know I can change the entire feel of the website 
by doing simple things like changing font size and color just by changing a few lines in the CSS file. 
</p>

<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
In-line CSS is great for making changes to a single portion of the site. Using inline CSS you can make style changes to a small section of the website to make it stand out. 
This is a great way to highlight sections, words, or phrases of your site so the user notices it easier. 
</p>

<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
Even though I knew much of the HTML5 code I used in this website, I found it helpful to take this class. It helped me understand how to use an external CSS style sheet to format 
the entire website. I look forward to taking the CSS class next quarter to learn more tips and tricks to styling the website and what CSS can do. I am sure there is much more that 
can be done with a CSS style sheet.
